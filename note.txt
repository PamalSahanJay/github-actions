git hub action

-how to use 3rd party libry in github actions
	these are bulid for the specific workflows.
		for an example to download the repository to the runner 
			we can use 
				- name: checkout repo
				  uses: actions/checkout@v4
				
				
- how to run multiple commands 
    - name: check files
      run: |
        ls -al
        cat example.txt
		
		
- before runnig 3rd party commands we need to install 3rd party library 
	- name: Generate ASCII art
      run: |
        echo "Hello, world!" | cowsay > ascii_art.txt
    - name: Display ASCII art
      run: |
        echo "Generated ASCII art:"
        cat ascii_art.txt
		
    this will be failed if you are not install cowsay library to the runner ( virtual environment )
	
- how to deploy multiple jobs

	if me add add mulitple jobs there are run parallel and differt virtual instances ( not in one )
	so that what ever file in the first job not visible to the second job
	  
- how to run multiple jobs in sequential 
	you just need to a add 
		test_job:
        needs: build_job
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
		
		deploy_job:
        needs: [test_job]
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
		
	we can give it as simple string or just like an array
	
- how to get visible other files in the vm to another vm
	first we have to upload it from a vm
		  - name: Upload File
              uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
              with:
                name: dragon-file
                path: dragon.txt

	other vm should download it 
		  - name: Download File
              uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
              with:
                name: dragon-file

	in here github keep upload file artifact ( here dragon-file by name) and we can donload it as well.
	
- how to explore variable an secrets
	we can define environment varable 
		in step level, in job level and in workflows level ( visibility depends on each level )

	name: Genarate Secrets and Variables
	on:
	  push:
		branches:
		  - main
	env:
		MY_EMAIL: "p.s.jayawickrama@gmail.com"

	jobs:
		first_job:
			runs-on: ubuntu-latest
			env:
				My_CITY: "Colombo"
			steps:
				- name: print my name and age
				  env:
					MY_NAME: "Pamal Shan"
					MY_AGE: "25"
				  run: echo "My name is $MY_NAME and I am ${{env.MY_AGE}} years old and I live in ${{env.My_CITY}}"
				- name: print my email
				  run: echo "My email is ${{env.MY_EMAIL}}"
