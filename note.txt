- how to get visible other files in the vm to another vm
	first we have to upload it from a vm
		  - name: Upload File
              uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
              with:
                name: dragon-file
                path: dragon.txt

	other vm should download it 
		  - name: Download File
              uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
              with:
                name: dragon-file

	in here github keep upload file artifact ( here dragon-file by name) and we can donload it as well.
